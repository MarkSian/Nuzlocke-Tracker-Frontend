# Pokemon: Nuzlocke Tracker

The Nuzlocke Tracker is a full-stack web application designed to help Pokémon Nuzlocke challengers to record and manage their playthroughs for any game version. It provides a digital companion to help players adhere to the challenging self-imposed rules while maintaining a detailed and visual history of their painful playthrough.

    - Current status (Captured, Fainted, Skipped, Upcoming)
    - Nature and Level
    - Route of capture/encounter
- Dynamic Pokémon Visuals: Seamlessly integrates with the PokeAPI to fetch and display official Pokémon sprites, enhancing the visual appeal of your tracked creatures.
- Box & Grave Views: Dedicated sections to easily review your active (boxed) Pokémon and those that have unfortunately fainted during the run, adhering to Nuzlocke's core rules.
